# Customer-segmentation-using-4-diffrent-clustering-technics
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters. In this course, the objective is to perform segmentation using clustering techniques for a given dataset of customers visiting a mall. 
Four different techniques will be applied and compared - KMeans, DBSCAN, MeanShift, and Agglomerative.
